# Web Report Designer

Since R2 2019, we offer a web-based report designer which allows creating and designing reports in the Report Server. 
Further information about this controll can be found in [Telerik Web Report Designer](https://docs.telerik.com/reporting/designing-reports/report-designer-tools/web-report-designer/overview) article.

### Data Connectivity

Report Server supports [WebService](https://docs.telerik.com/reporting/webservicedatasource-component), [JSON](https://docs.telerik.com/reporting/jsondatasource-component), [SQL](https://docs.telerik.com/reporting/sqldatasource) and inline [CSV](https://docs.telerik.com/reporting/csvdatasource-component) data sources.

### Report Resources
The Web Report Designer allows uploading shared resources like images, styles, and data on the server.
It makes them easily accessible and allows to reuse them among different reports to achieve and maintain a common report vision.
It also makes it easy to renew the offline data in JSON or CSV format for multiple reports visualizing it.
The respective tool is called Assets Manager and more information on how it can be used is available in the 
[Report shared resources](https://docs.telerik.com/reporting/designing-reports/report-designer-tools/web-report-designer/tools/shared-resources) article.
Note that in the context of the Report Server the reports are organized into one-level directories representing the report categories on the Report Server.

### Browsers Support
The Web Report Designer can run on web browsers that support JavaScript EcmaScript 6: Google Chrome 77.0 or newer; Mozilla Firefox 69.0 or later, Microsoft Edge 44.17763 or later.
