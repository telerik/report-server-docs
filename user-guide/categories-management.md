# Categories Management

The categories provide a way to arrange the reports in specific groups.

The categories grid provides the following functions:

* _Add category_ – adds a new category
* _Edit category_ – changes the category name
* _Delete category_ – deletes the category

Next to the category name in the grid, you can see the number of reports in that category. This number includes reports that are still not published.

> Categories that contain reports cannot be deleted.

You can search for categories by their name. For more information, see [Search]({%slug search%}#search).
