### Introduction

Progress® Telerik® Report Server is a server-based reporting platform that provides comprehensive reports management. It provides a centralized storage for the reports and various ways to organize and preview them.

Telerik Report Server provides a full range of ready-to-use tools and services to help you create, deploy, deliver, and manage reports for your organization. Report scheduling enables you to configure the automatic delivery of specified reports by e-mail at scheduled intervals. You can use your organization's AD FS or the Report Server's own authentication feature.

Telerik Report Server enables you to access reports from any device and has built-in caching capabilities for better performance and fast loading of the reports. Built-in user and user roles management gives you the ability to determine the permission for each user, so you can rest assured that the data viewed in reports is protected.

Report Server uses the advanced Telerik Reporting engine and the royalty-free Desktop Report Designer and Web Report Designer to easily create complex and visually appealing report definitions in our XML proprietary format (trdx). With Telerik Reporting, you can create interactive, tabular, graphical, or free-form reports from relational or multidimensional data sources. Reports can include rich data visualization, including charts, maps, and choropleths.

You can publish reports, and access reports on demand. Existing reports in XML format saved as TRDX files can be published directly. Reports created in Visual Studio will have to be serialized or imported into the Standalone Designer tool. You can select from a variety of viewing formats, and export reports to other applications such as Microsoft Excel. The reports that you create can be viewed over a Web-based connection.

All report viewers of Telerik Reporting for HTML5, ASP.NET WebForms, ASP.NET MVC, WinForms, and WPF apps can display reports stored on a Telerik Report Server in a web application. This lets the users view reports directly in the applications they use daily without the need to be registered Report Server users or to launch the Report Server web interface. They have the option of using a [Guest]({%slug guest-user%}) user account or personal user account.
