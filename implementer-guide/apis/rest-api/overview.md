# REST API Overview

The goal of the Report Server Application Programming Interface (Report Server API) is to enable developers to use the Report Server functionality inside their own applications. The API is implemented as a RESTful Web API service through which the server can be managed using simple HTTP requests. The API allows developers to control (Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD)) Report Server resources, such as Reports, Categories and Data Connections from within the client application. Additionally, you can schedule tasks and data alerts to achieve more complex reporting and business scenarios. The report server administrators are also allowed to change the Report Server settings remotely through the dedicated API.
