# Whitelabeling

>note Starting with the [2025 Q3](https://www.telerik.com/support/whats-new/report-server/release-history/progress-telerik-report-server-2025-q3-11-2-25-813) release, the whitelabeling functionality is now also available in the [Report Server for .NET]({%slug coming-soon%}) - [Whitelabeling in the Report Server for .NET]({%slug dotnet-server-whitelabeling%}).

Whitelabeling enables Report Server customers to remove branding elements in the Report Server web application and [Standalone Report Designer]({%slug report-designer%}) application and replace them with branding from the customer's enterprise.

The following elements can be rebranded:

* Colors - Accent Color, Selected Color, and Link Color.
* Logo - the logo image should be in PNG, GIF, or JPG file format. Recommended dimensions are 212 x 17 pixels.
* Favicon - the favicon should be in ICO, PNG, GIF, or JPG file format.

The whitelabeling feature can be found under _Configuration_ > _Whitelabeling_. Administrator rights are required to access the Report Server Configuration page.
