# Designer

The designer view allows you to change the language of the Standalone Designer. 

A drop down lists all languages available in the report server languages directory - `_TelerikReportServerInstallationDirectory_\Telerik.ReportServer.Web\Report Designer\Languages\_CultureName_`. By default, for the German language this would be `C:\Program Files (c86)\Progress\Telerik Report Server\Telerik.ReportServer.Web\Report Designer\Languages\de`.

For more information see [Localization]({%slug localization%}#localize-standalone-report-designer) article.
