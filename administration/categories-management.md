# Categories Management



The categories provide a way to arrange the reports in specific groups.

The categories grid provides the following functions:

  - _Add category_ – adds a new category
  - _Edit category_ – changes the category name
  - _Delete category_ – deletes the category

Next to the category name in the grid you can see the number of the reports in that category. This number include reports that are still not published.
>Categories which contain reports cannot be deleted.
