# Data Connections Management



The data connections view is a centralized place from which you can manage the connection strings of the reports' data sources. In this way by using a named connection string you can easily change the location of the database without actually modifying the report definitions.

The data connections view provides the following functions:

  - _Add a data connection_

A new data connection is defined by a _name_, a _description_, a _data provider_ and a _connection string_. 
>Make sure the connection string is referencing SQL server with a non local address. So the users can edit reports in report designer.

>Data connections with duplicate names are not allowed.

  - _Edit a data connection_  
The properties of an existing data connection can be modified at any time.
  - _Delete a data connection_  
You can delete an existing data connection when it is not used any more.
  - _Copy a data connection_  
To create a similar to an existing connection you can simply copy the source connection and modify its properties.
