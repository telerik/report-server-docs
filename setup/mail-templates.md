Mail Templates
==============================
Mail templates define the text which is sent via e-mail to the Report Server users for various reasons.

Available for configuration are the following mail templates:

-   **Reset Password** - specifies the mail template used by the Report Server when sending a 'reset password' link in case a local user has forgotten his password. The mail template must contain the {link} variable as it will provide the link for the user to the 'reset password' page.

-   **Activate Account** - specifies the mail template sent to a new local user so that he/she can activate his/her account. The mail template must contain the {link} variable as it will provide a link for the user to the account activation page.

-   **Scheduled Task Attachment** - specifies the default mail template used by the scheduling service when sending an e-mail with the generated report document. You can configure a more specific template for this action in the New/Edit Scheduled Task dialog.
    The variables which can be used only in this template type are:

    -   {FirstName} - the first name of the user

    -   {LastName} - the last name of the user

-   **Scheduled Task Attachment External -** specifies the mail template used by the scheduling service when sending an e-mail with the generated report document to an external user.

-   **Scheduled Task Error -** specifies the mail template sent by the scheduling service when there are errors during the report document generation. It might be a report processing error or general task scheduler error while trying to executed the scheduled task. If despite the errors a document has been generated then it will be sent as an attachment.
    The variables which can be used only in this template are:

    -   {Errors} - the errors that have occurred during the scheduled task execution.

The variables that are common for all **Scheduled Task** templates with a generated report document (i.e. templates with an attachment):

-   {DocumentFormat} - the specified in the scheduled task rendering format
