## Notes
If the email service has two factor authentication, you may need to get an app specific password. More information on this can be found in [the Manage App Passwords | Microsoft article](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/account-billing/manage-app-passwords-for-two-step-verification-d6dc8c6d-4bf7-4851-ad95-6d07799387e9).
