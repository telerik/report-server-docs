## Description

During RS.NET installation, the installer automatically configures the connection between the RS.NET web application and the RS.NET Service Agent. However, if the automatic configuration fails, you may need to manually configure this connection. In case the automatic configuration fails, opening `http://localhost:82/api/system/isalive` in the browser returns `404`.

> For versions prior to 2025 Q4 that relied on a combined installer for both RS and RS.NET, the RS.NET Service Agent is likely hosted on port 84 instead, and the URL should be `http://localhost:84/api/system/isalive`.

The RS.NET initialization follows this process:

1. When RS.NET starts for the first time, you go through the **Configure Storage** and **Register Administrator** pages. As a result, the settings are stored in the `ReportServerAdmin.json` file.
1. RS.NET checks its `appsettings.json` configuration file for the `InitialAgentUrl` key. This should contain a valid URL like `http://localhost:82` where the Service Agent is registered.
1. RS.NET calls the Service Agent URL and passes storage settings to it. These are saved in `ServiceAgent.json` in the Service Agent's directory.

### Manual Configuration Steps

If the automatic configuration fails, follow these steps:

1. Delete the file `{Installation Folder}\Telerik Report Server .NET\Services\ServiceAgent.json` from RS.NET Service Agent's folder if it exists.
1. Test whether the RS.NET Service Agent responds by calling the RS.NET Service Agent endpoint `/api/system/isalive` from the browser. By default, this is the URL `http://localhost:82/api/system/isalive`.
1. Open RS.NET's `appsettings.json` configuration file and add/edit the key `"InitialAgentUrl": "http://localhost:82"`. The value in the example assumes the RS.NET Service Agent is running on port _82_. Change the URL based on your settings.
1. Restart the RS.NET and RS.NET Service Agent.
1. Check the RS.NET's **Configuration** -> **ServiceAgent** page. The entry `"DefaultServiceAgent" : "http://localhost:82"` should now be present. The URL may differ, depending on your settings.
1. To use the RS.NET Service Agent, ensure the **Mail Server** settings in **Configuration** page are valid.
