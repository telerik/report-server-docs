## Description

How to upload a report in the Report Server using the public [API]({%slug rest-api-overview%}).

## Solution

A simple console application in `C#` demonstrating how to upload a report (_Concentric_NumericalScale_test.trdx_ that is included in the project) programmatically using the Report Server API is available in the attached [UseReportServerApi.zip file](https://www.telerik.com/docs/default-source/knowledgebasearticleattachments/reporting/usereportserverapi.zip?sfvrsn=7c04b2b5_2).

It is necessary to change the Log-in details to reflect your local settings, i.e. modify the following code accordingly:

````CSharp
class Program
{
	static void Main(string[] args)
	{
		ReportServerClient reportServerClient = new ReportServerClient(@"http://yourlocalreportserver:83/api/reportserver/");
		reportServerClient.Login("demoUser", "demoPass");
		//...
	}
}
````
