## Description

The Report Server application is installed and configured to run in 32-bit mode by default (see [Installation]({%slug installation%}) article) for compatibility reasons. To allow addressing more memory or using specific version of database drivers, the mode in which the Report Server is started may need to be changed.

## Solution

The mode in which the Report Server instance runs is determined by its application pool settings, which define it as a 32-bit application by default. To change it, navigate to the Report Server's application pool, open its `Advanced Settings` form and look for a `Enable 32-bit Applications` property. Change it to **False** to run the Report Server instance in 64-bit mode and recycle the pool.
