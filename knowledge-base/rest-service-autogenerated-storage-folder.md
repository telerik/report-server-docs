## Description

When the Telerik Report Server uses File Storage, the `Data` subfolder by default is used to store the Report Server data in the `TRS` subfolder. A subfolder with a name resembling GUID (e.g. `8963c32d`) is also autogenerated for the REST Service storage. If there are large reports generated on the Report Server this folder may occupy excessive space.

## Solution

The Telerik Report Server uses the same reporting engine as Telerik Reporting. When previewing reports the REST Service of the Report Server needs to cache resources - check [HTML5 Report Viewer and Reporting REST services](https://docs.telerik.com/reporting/embedding-reports/html5-viewer-telerik-rest-service). These resources are cached in a subfolder of the `Telerik.ReportServer.Web\Data\8963c32d` named on the version of Telerik Reporting used, e.g. `13.0.19.116`. This folder may be deleted as the temporary resources generated in it are no longer needed after closing the previewed reports, and their absence will not influence Report Server data/reports/users/etc.

This _REST Service storage_ is different from the [Report Server Storage]({%slug storage-settings%}) and is not migrated with the latter. However, the folders may remain after upgrade. They should be deleted manually to free the occupied space.

The Storage of the REST Service may be configured separately in the `Web.config` file of the application - by default in `(_Telerik Report Server installation folder_)\Telerik.ReportServer.Web`. More details can be found in the [Telerik Reporting Configuration-restReportService Element](https://docs.telerik.com/reporting/doc-output/configure-the-report-engine/restreportservice-element) article.
