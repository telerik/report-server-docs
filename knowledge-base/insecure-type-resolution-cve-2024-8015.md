## Temporary Mitigation

You can mitigate this vulnerability by changing Report Server’s Application Pool user to one with limited permissions.

If you do not already have a procedure for creating a dedicated App Pool user, you can reference our [How To Change IIS User for Report Server](https://docs.telerik.com/report-server/knowledge-base/how-to-change-report-server-iis-user) KB article for additional assistance.

## Notes

- You can check what version you are running by:
  1. Go to your Report Server web UI and log in using an account with administrator rights.
  1. Open the Configuration page (`~/Configuration/Index`).
  1. Select the About tab, the version number is displayed in the pane on the right.
- If you have any questions or concerns related to this issue, open a new Technical Support case in [Your Account | Support Center](https://www.telerik.com/account/support-center/contact-us/). Technical Support is available to Telerik customers with an active support plan.
