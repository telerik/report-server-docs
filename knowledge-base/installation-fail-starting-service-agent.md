## Environment

## Description

When upgrading an existing instance of the Report Server which uses [Microsoft SQL Server storage]({%slug storage-settings%}) to a newer version, the installation fails at the "Starting services" step
and then rolls back the upgrade.

The Report Server installation installs and runs an instance of the *Telerik.ReportServer.ServiceAgent* service which is a local Windows service.
By default the *Telerik.ReportServer.ServiceAgent* runs under the **Local System** account (**NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM**). When this account does not have login permissions for
Microsoft SQL Server the *Telerik.ReportServer.ServiceAgent* cannot start because it cannot connect to the database configured in the Report Server [storage settings]({%slug storage-settings%}).
This is the reason for the installation failure at the "Starting services" step.

## Solution

The following solutions are available:

- Grant the required permissions to the **NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM** account, so it can access the database configured in the Report Server [storage settings]({%slug storage-settings%}).

- Change the account under which the *Telerik.ReportServer.ServiceAgent* service is running to an account which has permissions for the storage database.
